It is the one of two biomes where huge mushrooms can spawn naturally, and where mushrooms can grow in full sunlight.\nTechnically no mobs other than mooshrooms spawn naturally in this biome, including the usual night-time hostile mobs. This also applies to caves, abandoned mine shafts, and other structures underground, meaning exploring underground is supposedly safe. However most mushroom islands have at least 1 square of another biome on them (a single piece of grass mixed in with the mycelium) which allows hostile mobs to spawn freely on the majority of mushroom islands. Monster spawners will still spawn mobs, and the player will still be able to breed animals and spawn mobs using items.\nTrees can be grown from saplings in this biome, as well as other dirt or grass-based plants, as long as they are not directly adjacent to mycelium, which will take over the dirt square from the plant and uproot it. Mycelium cannot be tilled directly, but it can be dug away and replaced as dirt, then immediately tilled. Once created, farmland can resist takeover by mycelium."

    "description": "A large, open biome made entirely of water going up to y=63, with underwater relief on the sea floor, such as small mountains and plains, usually including gravel. Oceans typically extend under 3,000 blocks in any direction. Small islands with infrequent vegetation can be found in oceans. Passive mobs are unable to spawn on these islands, but hostiles can. Cavern entrances can be found infrequently at the bottom of the ocean. In the Console versions, they surround the edges of the map.."

Ice Mountains are usually taller, with height comparable to Extreme Hills biomes."
