One of them look quite weird as parts of it has been destroyed. This is likely due to the fact that it’s been cut off by the other monument. To use this seed you will need version 0.15.9 or above of Minecraft Pocket Edition. Once you’ve spawned make sure to drink a potion of night vision. That’s assuming you are in creative mode. It will still be possible to find the ocean monuments if you are in survival but it will be a little bit more difficult. The spawn is on a medium sized island.

Well, this is a great opportunity because not only will you find one village, no, you will in fact find three villages right at spawn. They are all tightly combined making them appear as one big city. This is an overview of the entire triple village which can be found at spawn. It is situated on two sides of a river which is also the border of two different biomes: a savannah and a flat grass landscape. One of the houses in the savannah biome has been generated on the inside of a hill. When we checked it out there was about five villagers trapped in there so perhaps you can make it one of your first missions to save them? In the center of a village there is a cave opening. It’s a great start for building a mine. There is a fourth village which can be found a bit further away. If you have full render distance on you will be able to see it from the triple village.",

The spawn is at a swamp biome. Continue straight ahead past the swamp. Soon enough you should come to a forest which is situated on the right. But just continue going straight ahead.

After following the river for a while it’s time to turn right and cross over the sand dunes to make your way to the first temple. If it is your first time entering a temple then you must be careful as there is a redstone trap constructed using a pressure plate and TNT at the bottom of the temple where all the treasures are. Destroy the blocks in the center of the floor and then use blocks to make a pathway down to the bottom. You will die if you decide to drop down (at least if you play in survival mode).
