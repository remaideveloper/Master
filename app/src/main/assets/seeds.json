Destroy the blocks in the center of the temple to enter the room where all the treasures can be found. Just watch out for the pressure plate in the middle because it sets of a TNT trap.

Usually they consist of diamonds, iron ingots and gold. In this seed we will show you have to get to three different temples all with incredible treasures to be found and collected. The spawn is at a swamp biome. Continue straight ahead past the swamp. Soon enough you should come to a forest which is situated on the right. But just continue going straight ahead. After a little while the forest should end and a flat landscape should be seen ahead. When you have passed the flat landscape and come to a river with two forests on each side then you know it’s time to turn right. Follow the path of the river. After following the river for a while it’s time to turn right and cross over the sand dunes to make your way to the first temple. If it is your first time entering a temple then you must be careful as there is a redstone trap constructed using a pressure plate and TNT at the bottom of the temple where all the treasures are. Destroy the blocks in the center of the floor and then use blocks to make a pathway down to the bottom. You will die if you decide to drop down (at least if you play in survival mode). Also, make sure to avoid the pressure plate as it will set off the trap. Make your way back to the entrance of the temple. To find the second temple make sure you look in the direction as seen in the image below and follow the path of the river for a little while.",
